# Mobile App Usage Analysis (October–November 2025)

## Overview
This project applies **data mining** and **machine learning** techniques to analyze mobile app usage patterns collected during October–November 2025. The goal was to explore behavioral differences across days, detect meaningful trends, and demonstrate practical application of algorithms and visualization methods learned about data mining.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw usage data
- Explore overall mobile activity and detect outliers
- Compare **weekday vs weekend** usage
- Analyze **daily and monthly trends** (October vs November)
- Study **app-specific behavior** (Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, Google)
- Investigate correlations and autocorrelations between app usages
- Apply statistical testing (Hotelling’s T²) to compare multivariate means
- Build a **logistic regression model** to classify weekdays vs weekends

## Key Insights
- **Higher overall mobile usage on weekends**, with YouTube as the strongest weekend indicator  
- **Instagram and WhatsApp** show steady usage but still positively associated with weekends  
- Distinct **patterns by day of the week**, revealing routines and unexpected but logical trends  
- Statistical and ML methods confirmed that **greater app usage generally signals weekend behavior**

## Methods & Techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory visualization (time series, comparisons, correlations)
- Outlier detection
- Equi-width binning for categorization
- Hotelling’s T² statistical test
- Logistic regression for classification

## Conclusion
This project was a rewarding way to apply data mining knowledge in practice. It revealed insightful patterns in mobile usage behavior and demonstrated the value of combining technical tools with thoughtful analysis. The work highlights how even personal datasets can yield meaningful results when approached with rigorous methods.
